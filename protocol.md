# The Sovrin Protocol
The Sovrin Network is a pioneer in Self-Sovereign Identity 
(SSI). This style of digital identity is designed to be 
private, secure and in control of the owner of the Identity. 
SSI enables trusted interactions between individuals, 
organizations, and things. These interactions often need to 
be bidirectional in ways that differ fundamentally from 
assumptions made for the traditional Client-server model. 
These interactions need to be initiated by both parties. 
These interactions need to be verifiable by both parties. 
These interactions need to be private. 

## Asynchronized Messaging
The framework provides the construct that both parties in an
interaction could require human input. Additionally, either 
party may require time to consider either party's terms. 
These terms could be complex or simple. These terms could 
have short or long term implications. Because of this, it's 
important that either party have time to consider what is 
being negotiated. Asynchronous message allows either party 
time to respond to messages.
