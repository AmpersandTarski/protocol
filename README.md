# The Sovrin Protocol

The Sovrin Protocol is a set of standards, patterns, and tools that facilitate
trusted interactions. People, institutions, and things can use this
protocol to interact with one another in many different ways--but
always as peers, in patterns that are easy, powerful, secure, and private.

The protocol adapts to many different circumstances. it can be used on the
internet, over sneakernet, or even with snail mail.

The protocol is rooted in principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Instead of
having powerful institutions grant marginalized people identities based
on siloed data, SSI puts identity owners in charge. They create their
own identity, manage keys, and share personal data however they want,
without constraints or approval from others. Nobody can take their identity
away.

## Safe and Empowered Digital Interactions

Alice wants to interact with many different parties.

She wants to interact with minimal reliance on third parties. She wants to control her interactions such that another party cannot interfere with her interactions.

Alice's digital interactions should be safe. Safe from prying eyes. Safe from services that track her without her knowledge and consent. Safe from unwanted correlation. Compromised third parties should not be able to impersonate her, or impersonate others to her. She should be safe from apps that exploit their positions of trust. Safe from disclosing more information about herself than is needed. 

Alice's digital interactions should be easy. Being secure should not be harder than not being secure. She shouldn't have to make a decision to be private; she should be private by default. She should have good information about the intent of interactions. Her apps should help her make good decisions about what to share and who to trust. 

Alice should be able to establish trust with another party with minimal reliance on third parties and minimal exchange of personal information. She should be able to make informed decisions about who is trustworthy. She should be able to share her reputation and attributes across contexts without revealing private information. Alice should have strong assurances in her digital interactions without the need for exchanging secrets and personal information.

Alice's digital interactions should be essentially free, regardless of her circumstances and regardless of where she lives in the world. The cost of interactions should not be an inhibitor to interaction. Alice should not feel compelled to give up privacy in exchange for the ability to interact digitally, or compelled to exchange her personal information for services.

##Key components of the Sovrin Protocol include:

* [Janus](janus/README.md) (a subprotocol for secure and private communication)
* [Themis](themis/README.md) (a subprotocol for issuing digital credentials and proving things with them in a privacy-preserving way)
* [Hermes](hermes/README.md) (a subprotocol for exchanging economic value)
