# The Sovrin Protocol

The Sovrin Protocol is a set of standards, patterns, and tools that facilitate
trusted interactions. People, institutions, and things can use this
protocol to interact with one another in many different ways--but
always as peers, in patterns that are easy, powerful, secure, and private.

The protocol adapts to many different circumstances. it can be used on the
internet, over sneakernet, or even with snail mail.

The protocol is rooted in principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Instead of
having powerful institutions grant marginalized people identities based
on siloed data, SSI puts identity owners in charge. They create their
own identity, manage keys, and share personal data however they want,
without constraints or approval from others. Nobody can take their identity
away.

##Key components of the Sovrin Protocol include:

* [Janus](janus/README.md) (a subprotocol for secure and private communication)
* [Themis](themis/README.md) (a subprotocol for issuing digital credentials and proving things with them in a privacy-preserving way)
* [Hermes](hermes/README.md) (a subprotocol for exchanging economic value)
