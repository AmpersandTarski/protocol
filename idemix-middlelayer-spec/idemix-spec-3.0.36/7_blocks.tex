\section{Building Blocks}

In this Section we describe the cryptographic building blocks supported
by the Idmx library, and list their interfaces.
We start by describing interfaces that are shared by
multiple building blocks. 
Section~\ref{sec:blocks:common} we outline the interfaces that are shared among most 
building blocks.
In Section~\ref{sec:blocks:major} we describe
the major building blocks, which are \emph{abstract} interfaces, and
list their concrete realization in Section~\ref{sec:blocks:major:impl}.
Further, Section~\ref{sec:blocks:helper} we describe
the helper building blocks, which are used as ``subroutines'' by the major blocks.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:blocks:structural} we describe the structural
building blocks, whose role it is to configure the zero-knowledge proof.
